Climate Change Frequently Asked Questions:

1.What is the definition of Climate Change?

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate change as:
"The change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, 
and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.

2. What does climate change mainly refers to?

Climate change refers to significant and long-term changes in global or regional climate patterns. 
These changes can result from both natural processes and human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases such 
as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere.


4.How does different sectors of energy, agricluture , industry , waste, LULUCF affect greenhouse gas emissions?


Each of these sectors plays a significant role in influencing climate change:

Energy Sector: The burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation, heating, transportation, and industrial processes releases 
carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change.

Agriculture: Agricultural activities such as livestock farming, rice cultivation, and fertilizer use emit methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O), potent greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Land-use changes associated with agriculture, such as 
deforestation for cropland expansion, also release CO2 into the atmosphere.

Industry: Industrial processes, including cement production, chemical manufacturing, and metal smelting, emit CO2 and other greenhouse
 gases through combustion, chemical reactions, and other industrial activities.

Waste Management: Landfills and waste treatment facilities generate methane as organic waste decomposes anaerobically. Additionally, 
incineration of waste releases CO2 and other pollutants into the atmosphere.

LULUCF: Land-use changes, such as deforestation, afforestation, reforestation, and forest degradation, alter the balance of greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, while deforestation and degradation release stored 
carbon back into the atmosphere.

5. Which are the countries belongs to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) AnnexI?

6.What is Lowess Smoothing?
7. What are  three latitude bands?
8. What are El Niño and La Niña events?
El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, 
which is a natural climate phenomenon originating in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

El Niño: This phase occurs when sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer than average. 
It can lead to a disruption in normal weather patterns, resulting in increased rainfall and flooding in some regions
 (such as South America) and droughts in others (such as Australia and Indonesia). El Niño events typically occur every 2-7 years 
 and can have widespread impacts on weather and climate around the world.

La Niña: In contrast, La Niña is characterized by cooler than average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern 
Pacific Ocean. La Niña events often bring the opposite effects of El Niño, including increased rainfall in some regions 
(such as Southeast Asia and Australia) and drought conditions in others (such as South America and the southwestern United States). 
La Niña events can also influence global weather patterns and climate variability.

Both El Niño and La Niña events can have significant impacts on agriculture, fisheries, water resources, and extreme weather events 
such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Understanding and monitoring these phenomena are crucial for predicting and managing their 
impacts on societies and ecosystems worldwide.
